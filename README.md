# Forkify
Forkify is a recipe search and bookmarking application that allows users to find and save their favourite recipes. It was built while learning Javascript from the Udemy instructor Jonas Schmedtmann. The application is built using HTML, SaSS, and Javascript, and uses the Forkify API to fetch recipes.

## Features
1. Search for recipes: Users can search for recipes by typing in keywords such as ingredients, recipe name or cuisine type.
2. Upload your own new recipe: Users can upload their own recipes to the application. These recipes can be saved and bookmarked like other recipes on the site.
3. Bookmark your favourite recipes: Users can save their favourite recipes to their bookmarks. These bookmarks are stored in the user's browser using local storage.

## Technologies Used
1. HTML: Used to create the user interface and structure of the application.
2. SaSS: Used to style the user interface of the application.
3. Javascript: Used to create the functionality of the application, including fetching data from the Forkify API and manipulating the DOM.
4. NPM: Used to manage and install packages and dependencies.
5. Forkify API: Used to fetch recipe data for the application.
